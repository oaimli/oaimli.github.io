*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.             ------ Victor Hugo*

#### Brief Bio

I'm currently a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne ([UoM](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/)), where I started the PhD journey at the end of 2020. Previously, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University ([NEU](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted master student at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/)) and got M.E. in July 2020 from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)). 

#### Research Interests

My research interests fall in developing machine learning models for natural language processing and text mining. The current research focuses on knowledge enhanced natural language generation, especially neural abstractive summarization.
