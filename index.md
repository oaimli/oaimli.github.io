### Brief Bio

Miao is currently a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), advised equally by [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUFxrroAAAAJ&hl=en) (UoM and [CMU](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/)) and [Dr. Jey Han Lau](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MFi65f4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (UoM) within [Natural Language Processing Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing). He will be a visiting researcher under supervision of [Prof. Mirella Lapata](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=j67B9Q4AAAAJ&hl=en) at [ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) for half year since March 2024. His PhD journey at UoM started in December 2020. Before PhD, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University in 2017, he studied as an exam-exempted master's student at State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, China and completed M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

### Research Interests

Throughout the years of pursuing the PhD degree, Miao's primary area of interest revolves around multi-document language processing with an application of abstractive summarization. While modern large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) have demonstrated the ability to generate plausible summaries, their effectiveness in consolidating information from multiple documents remains uncertain. Miao's PhD research aims to evaluate and enhance the multi-document information consolidation capability of natural language generation systems in multi-document summarization. In the long term, Miao's research goal is to systematically investigate how humans and machines form factual understanding or opinionated judgments through the assimilation of information from multiple sources, and achieve powerful natural language generation which can effectively comprehend multi-source information with intricate interactions among different modalities.
