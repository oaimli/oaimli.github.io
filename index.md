*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.             ------ Victor Hugo*

#### Brief Bio

I'm currently a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), working with [AI-NLP Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/Natural-Language-Processing). I commenced at UoM in December 2020. Previously, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted master student in State Key Laboratory of Computer Science in China and got M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 

#### Research Interests

My research interest falls in developing machine learning models mainly with deep neural networks for natural language processing, which is a sub-field in artificial intelligence with the aim of helping machines understand and generate natural language like human beings. In these years, the doctoral research is focused on neural document modeling and abstractive summarization. The target is to identify the essence of texts and generate high-quality textual summaries in an abstractive fashion, which would help to cope with information overload.
