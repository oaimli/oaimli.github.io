### Brief Bio

I'm currently a doctoral candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), advised equally by [Dr. Jey Han Lau](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MFi65f4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (UoM) and [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUFxrroAAAAJ&hl=en) (UoM and CMU) within [Natural Language Processing Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing). My academic journey at UoM commenced in December 2020. Prior to that, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted master's student at State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, China and completed M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 

### Research Interests

My research interests are centred around large-scale knowledge organization and reasoning over lengthy or multiple documents for content-based natural language generation. Based on comprehensive understanding of substantial amounts of information and accurate reasoning over intricate semantics in complex input documents, intelligent natural language generation systems are expected to output high-quality natural language texts in alignment with human intents. This should be a fundamental capability of the expected artificial intelligence which enables human beings to obtain knowledge in natural language format from massive documents effortlessly. 

Throughout my years of pursuing the Ph.D. degree, my research has primarily focused on modelling and evaluation for abstractive multi-document summarization, emphasizing the understanding and modelling of the underlying logic of integrating and aggregating intricate semantics in the human summarization process especially handling complex text relationships, e.g., the reasoning logic of meta-reviewers to write meta-reviews in peer-review systems. With a focus on the reasoning logic of multi-document summarization, specific research topics that I have been working on or currently interested in are as follows.
- Language learning for multi-document summarization with better understanding and modelling text relationships;
- Systematic evaluation of machine-generated texts, particularly for text summarization in an abstractive manner;
- Effective calibration of large language models for specialist tasks and domains, and their rational analysis;
- Data-centric methods with a focus on the quality of data to improve the performance of automatic text generation.
