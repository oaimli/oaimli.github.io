### Brief Bio

Miao is currently a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne ([UoM](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/)), advised equally by [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUFxrroAAAAJ&hl=en) (UoM and [CMU](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/)) and [Dr. Jey Han Lau](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MFi65f4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (UoM) within [Natural Language Processing Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing). He has been doing visiting research under the supervision of [Prof. Mirella Lapata](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=j67B9Q4AAAAJ&hl=en) at [ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) since March 2024. His PhD journey at UoM started in December 2020. Before PhD, after obtaining a B.E. from Northeastern University in 2017, he studied as an exam-exempted master's student at State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, China and completed his M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

### Research Interests

Miao is interested in natural language processing (NLP) which aims to enable computers to understand, reason with, and generate natural language. Throughout the years of pursuing the PhD, his primary area of interest revolves around **multi-document language generation**, which requires computational models to possess information selection and reasoning capabilities over multiple source documents. Miao's PhD research aims to investigate multi-document language generation from the perspective of **information consolidation** and **complex reasoning** and make the generation process less opaque and more grounded. In the long term, Miao's overarching research goal is to (1) understand how humans comprehend multi-source information with reasoning to make their decisions in language production from first principles, (2) explore the potential of computers to achieve superhuman-level information consolidation and reasoning over **multiple sources with voluminous and complex heterogeneous information** and realize human-like communication conveying information based on devised consequences from them, and (3) develop high-quality evaluations on not only output generations but also inner workings of artificial intelligence systems for complex natural language generation tasks.
