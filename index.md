### Brief Bio

I'm currently a doctoral candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), advised equally by [Dr. Jey Han Lau](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MFi65f4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (UoM) and [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUFxrroAAAAJ&hl=en) (UoM and CMU) within [Natural Language Processing Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing). My academic journey at UoM commenced in December 2020. Prior to that, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted master's student at State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, China and completed M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 

### Research Interests

My research interests are centred around large-scale information consolidation over multiple documents for content-based natural language generation. To output high-quality natural language texts in alignment with human intents, natural language generation systems have to achieve a comprehensive understanding of substantial amounts of information and accurate consolidation over intricate semantics in complex input documents. This fundamental capability of the expected artificial intelligence would enable human beings to obtain knowledge in natural language format from massive textual data effortlessly.

Throughout my years of pursuing the Ph.D. degree, my primary area of interest revolves around abstractive multi-document summarization, emphasizing the understanding and modelling of the underlying logic of integrating and aggregating intricate semantics in the human summarization process, e.g., the logic of meta-reviewers to write meta-reviews in peer-review systems. While modern summarization models could produce plausible summaries, it remains uncertain whether they truly possess the ability to effectively consolidate multi-document information and reason over source documents and how the capability can be enhanced. With a focus on the underlying logic of abstractive multi-document summarization, specific research topics that I have been working on or currently show interest in are as follows.
- Modelling explicit and implicit complex text relationships for abstractive multi-document summarization;
- Understanding and modelling the underlying judgement logic to write a meta-review in peer-reviewing;
- Evaluating and enhancing summarization models by considering the underlying knowledge reasoning logic;
- Improving large-scale reasoning capabilities of summarization models through the lens of data quality.
