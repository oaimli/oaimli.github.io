*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.             ------ Victor Hugo*

#### Brief Bio

I'm currently a PhD student at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne ([UoM](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/)), where I got enrolment at the end of 2020. Previously, after obtaining the Bachelor's degree in Northeastern University ([NEU](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted postgraduate at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/)) and got the Master's degree in July 2020 from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)). 

#### Research Interests

My research interests fall in developing machine learning models for natural language processing and text mining. The current research focuses on knowledge enhanced text generation, especially neural abstractive summarization.
