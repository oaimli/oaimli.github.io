### Brief Bio

Miao is currently a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), advised equally by [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUFxrroAAAAJ&hl=en) (UoM and [CMU](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/)) and [Dr. Jey Han Lau](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MFi65f4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (UoM) within [Natural Language Processing Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing). He has been doing visiting research under the supervision of [Prof. Mirella Lapata](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=j67B9Q4AAAAJ&hl=en) at [ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) since March 2024. His PhD journey at UoM started in December 2020. Before PhD, after obtaining a B.E. from Northeastern University in 2017, he studied as an exam-exempted master's student at State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, China and completed his M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

### Research Interests

Throughout the years of pursuing the PhD degree, Miao's primary area of interest revolves around multi-document language processing, with a special focus on multi-document summarization. While automated text summarization has achieved significant progress and pre-trained language models have demonstrated the capability to generate plausible summaries, the effectiveness of consolidating information from multiple documents remains uncertain and largely unexplored when these models are asked to summarize a collection of documents. Miao's PhD research aims to investigate multi-document summarization from the perspective of information consolidation and make it less opaque and more grounded. 

In the long term, Miao's overarching research goal is to (1) explore the potential for machines to achieve superhuman-level reasoning and consolidation over multiple heterogeneous documents with voluminous and complex information and realize human-like communication conveying information based on devised consequences from them, and (2) develop high-quality evaluations of artificial intelligence systems on these complex language generation tasks.
