*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.  &emsp;--- Victor Hugo*

### Brief Bio

I'm currently a doctoral candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), advised equally by [Dr. Jey Han Lau](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MFi65f4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (UoM) and [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUFxrroAAAAJ&hl=en) (UoM and CMU) within [Natural Language Processing Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/research/Natural-Language-Processing). My academic journey at UoM commenced in December 2020. Prior to that, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted master's student at State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, China and completed M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 

### Research Interests

My research interests are centered around developing computational models to enhance the natural language generation capabilities of machines, particularly in scenarios involving lengthy or multiple input documents with substantial amounts of information and intricate semantics. Human beings have difficulty in effectively comprehending lengthy or multiple documents holistically in a short time owing to the limited reading speed and memory capacity. I firmly believe that machines will overcome the difficulty by effectively and efficiently processing complex documents, and ideal automated natural language generation systems could generate high-quality natural language texts in alignment with human intents according to the comprehensive and in-depth understanding of input documents. This should be a fundamental capability of the expected AI which enables human beings to obtain knowledge in natural language format from massive documents effortlessly.

Throughout my years of pursuing the Ph.D. degree, my research has primarily focused on abstractive text summarization, emphasizing the understanding and modelling of intricate underlying logic in the human summarization process especially handling complex text relationships in multi-document summarization, e.g., meta-review generation.

Specific research topics that I have been working on or currently interested in are as follows.
- Multi-document summarization with understanding and modelling intricate text relationships;
- Effective language learning for lengthy and multiple documents with facts or opinions;
- Systematic evaluation of natural language generation, particularly for text summarization;
- Rational diagnosis of large language models (LLMs) based on language-related theories;
- Effective calibration of LLMs for specialist tasks, and their collaborative learning;
- Data-centric methods (quality and efficiency) for better automatic text generation systems.
