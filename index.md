*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.             ------ Victor Hugo*

#### Brief Bio

I'm currently studying for the Ph.D. at School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne (UoM), where I started the PhD journey at the end of 2020. Previously, after obtaining B.E. from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2017, I studied as an exam-exempted master student in State Key Laboratory of Computer Science in China and got M.Sc. in July 2020 from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 

#### Research Interests

My research interests fall in developing machine learning models mainly with deep neural networks for natural language processing and text mining, which is a sub-filed in artificial intelligence. The current PhD research focuses on neural document modeling and abstractive summarization which aims to generate high-quality textual summaries of the source documents in an abstractive fashion.
